# Amazon-Web-Scraping
This is a fun project in which I learned HTML stucture and used BeautifulSoup package on python to track the price of my desired item on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) on a daily basis.
The daily price record is tracked in a csv document, and system could automatically sends email to me when the price is below certain threshold.
